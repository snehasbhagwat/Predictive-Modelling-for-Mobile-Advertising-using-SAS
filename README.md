# Predictive-Modelling-for-Mobile-Advertising-using-SAS
• Built Linear Probability and Logistic Regression Models in SAS to predict the probability of installing the mobile Application based on Ad publisher and consumer characteristics
• Used different selection criteria i.e. Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, Stepwise Selection, and Cross Validation to select the best predictive model
• Calculated the threshold based on total misclassification cost to increase the probability of installing the App
